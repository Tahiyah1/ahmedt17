    <h2>The Growing Risks of Data Breaches</h2>
    <p>As technology advances, the risks to data privacy are becoming more complex. Hackers are constantly trying to break into systems and steal personal information. Data breaches, where hackers access sensitive data, are one of the biggest threats to data privacy. One of the most infamous data breaches occurred in 2017 when Equifax, a credit reporting agency, was hacked. The breach exposed the personal information of 147 million people, including social security numbers and credit card details. This is just one example of how vulnerable personal data can be.</p>

    <h3>Phishing Scams</h3>
    <p>Phishing is another common way that personal information gets stolen. This happens when cybercriminals trick people into revealing sensitive information, such as passwords and credit card numbers. They often do this by impersonating trusted organizations, like banks or government agencies. Phishing scams are dangerous because they can be hard to detect. According to IBM, phishing is responsible for 15% of all data breaches, and it costs companies millions of dollars every year.</p>

    <h3>Social Media and Tracking Technologies</h3>
    <p>Social media is another area where personal data is at risk. People often share a lot of personal information on these platforms, like their location, preferences, and daily activities. This information can be used by companies to target ads or, in some cases, even manipulate users. For example, the Facebook-Cambridge Analytica scandal showed how personal data could be used to influence elections. Additionally, websites and apps use tracking tools to collect information about users. These tools help businesses build profiles to target ads more effectively, but they can also be used maliciously to steal personal information.</p>
